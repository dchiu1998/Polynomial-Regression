# Polynomial-Regression
MATLAB project to find least squares polynomial regression.

1) FitPolynomialRegression finds the optimal weights for polynomial regression given a set of training data.
2) EvalPolynomial evaluates a polynomial given weight vector w and input vector x
3) GetBestPolynomial takes in a set of training data, a set of test data, and the highest degree of polynomial to consider.
It then returns the degree of the polynomial of the best model, based on its residual error.
